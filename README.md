# Data Pipeline ETL Solution Using PySpark and Airflow
Create a comprehensive data integration workflow that seamlessly moves and transforms data from multiple sources to a centralized storage system. The goal is to create a scalable, efficient data pipeline that transforms raw, potentially messy data into a clean, structured format ready for business intelligence and decision-making processes.

This project involves:
Data Extraction: Collect raw data from diverse sources including:
-Comma-separated value (CSV) files
-JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files
-Relational database systems

Initial Storage: Temporarily store source data in an Amazon S3 bucket for initial processing.
Data Transformation with PySpark: Execute advanced data processing techniques such as:

Data cleansing to remove inconsistencies
Filtering to isolate relevant information
Aggregation to summarize and condense data

Final Data Deployment: Transfer the refined, processed data to a designated AWS S3 bucket for further analysis, reporting, or downstream applications.
